## Overview
In this project, I performed an SQL-based analysis of Netflix's movie and TV show dataset. The main purpose was to explore the data, gain useful insights, and answer relevant business questions. This README explains the project's objectives, the questions explored, the methods used, and the key findings.

## Objectives
- Examine how content is distributed between movies and TV shows.

- Determine the most frequent ratings assigned to both movies and TV shows.

- Analyze content based on release year, country of origin, and duration.

- Investigate and classify titles using specific keywords and custom criteria.

## Dataset

The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:

    FROM dbo.netflix
    GROUP BY type, rating
),
ranked AS (
    SELECT 
        type,
        rating,
        total,
        RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY type ORDER BY total DESC) AS ranking
    FROM rating_counts
)
SELECT 
    type,
    rating,
    total,
    ranking
FROM ranked
WHERE ranking = 1
ORDER BY type;
```

FROM netflix
WHERE
	TRY_CAST(date_added AS DATE) >= DATEADD(YEAR, -4, GETDATE())
```

    SELECT 
        CASE 
              WHEN LOWER(description) LIKE '%kill%' 
              OR LOWER(description) LIKE '%murder%' 
              OR LOWER(description) LIKE '%violence%' 
              OR LOWER(description) LIKE '%crime%' 
              OR LOWER(description) LIKE '%blood%' THEN 'Very Bad'

            WHEN LOWER(description) LIKE '%fight%' 
              OR LOWER(description) LIKE '%war%' 
              OR LOWER(description) LIKE '%death%' 
              OR LOWER(description) LIKE '%gun%' THEN 'Bad'
